# Faster RCNN Tensorflow implementation on the Dataset

Steps to follow:
1. Add annotation files of the form OpenImage-v6 to the two folders "train" and "val" under "labels" folder
2. Run the "dataset-preparation-frcnn" script (make sure to adjust the dataset location)
3. train.csv, val.csv, annotations.txt, and annotations-val.txt files will be automatically created in the working directory
